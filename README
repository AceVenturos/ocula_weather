Tried utilising both repos linked in the requirements document - I ended up spending an afternoon trying to solve an
issue with one installing the Poetry dependency which occurred during the docker compose step. I decided to build from
scratch utilising small parts of the repos as a guide.

Reviewing the requirements, the One Call API's Daily Aggregation made the most sense as it returned the daily min, max,
humidity and enough datapoints to derive an average temperature per day.

Moving Forward:
- I would like to finish and deploy the weather_api via GitHub actions
- Add more unit/api tests and/or validation i.e. invalid data format being passed
- Utilise an SQL database to cache calls to minimise repeated API calls
- General refactoring/code clean-up
- Would look into what the best practice or solutions requires when calculating the average temperature

Questions (More for my own learning):
- What are best practices in handling/storing API keys?
